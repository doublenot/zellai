## 2026-04-23 02:57 — Workspace management: data model, persistence, and CLI commands

Built the workspace layer end-to-end: a `Workspace` data model with templates (solo, pair, team, orchestrator-top), JSON file persistence with save/load/list/delete, and the three CLI commands (`zellai new`, `zellai list`, `zellai kill`) that create Zellij sessions from workspace configs. Also hardened `zellai run` with proper signal handling so wrapped agents clean up status files on SIGINT/SIGTERM, and removed redundant agent detection logic. Next is `zellai attach` for reconnecting to existing workspaces, then the teams command and `zellai.toml` project config.

## 2026-04-22 13:52 — Generic wrapper `zellai run` and status_writer tests

Implemented `zellai run <command>` so any agent (Codex, Gemini, Aider, etc.) can emit status files by wrapping its process — the wrapper detects the agent kind from the command name, writes status JSON on start/stop, and cleans up on exit. Added thorough unit tests for `StatusWriter` including agent auto-detection, session ID generation, and sessions directory resolution. Also fixed an output filename collision bug and a tilde expansion issue that broke path resolution. Next is named wrappers (`zellai-codex`, `zellai-gemini`, `zellai-aider`) and workspace management (`zellai new`, `zellai attach`, `zellai list`).

## 2026-04-21 22:07 — CLI binary scaffold and `zellai init`

Added a dual-target CLI binary (`src/bin/zellai/`) that builds natively alongside the WASM plugin, then implemented `zellai init` to auto-detect a `.claude/` directory and install the three hook scripts (`on-stop.sh`, `on-notification.sh`, `on-post-tool-use.sh`) into it. The dual-target approach worked cleanly — the plugin stays `wasm32-wasip1` while the CLI uses standard `std::fs`/`std::process` on the host. Next is the generic wrapper (`zellai run <command>`) so non-Claude agents can also emit status files.

## 2026-04-21 19:34 — Attention tracking and Claude Code hooks

Added the `AttentionTracker` module with priority-based rotation, dismissal, and idle detection, then wired `mark_stale` and session cleanup into the plugin event loop so stale agents get flagged automatically. Finished by writing the three Claude Code hook scripts (`on-stop.sh`, `on-notification.sh`, `on-post-tool-use.sh`) that emit status JSON to the sessions directory. The full read path now connects end-to-end: hooks write status → bridge reads it → sidebar renders it → attention highlights what needs your eye. Next is `zellai init` to auto-detect `.claude/` and install these hooks for real projects.

## 2026-04-21 18:45 — Status bridge and sidebar rendering

Built the pure-data `StatusBridge` layer for managing agent sessions (add/remove/stale-mark/sort), then wired it into the plugin event loop with `Timer` subscriptions and `run_command` for non-blocking file reads. Finished by implementing the sidebar renderer with compact and detailed card modes plus adaptive density selection based on available rows. All three pieces landed cleanly with passing tests and clippy. Next is Claude Code hooks — auto-detecting `.claude/` and writing `on-stop.sh` / `on-notification.sh` / `on-post-tool-use.sh` so real agent sessions produce status files.

## 2026-04-21 15:36 — Foundation trilogy: config, status, plugin scaffold

Built the three foundational pieces in one session: `ZellaiConfig` with serde defaults and validation, `AgentStatus` model with JSON parsing and staleness detection, and the minimal `ZellijPlugin` trait impl that compiles to `wasm32-wasip1`. Kept all logic pure and unit-testable — no Zellij host API calls yet, so `cargo test --lib` covers everything. Next up is the status bridge: subscribing to `Timer` events in the plugin, reading status files via `run_command`, and wiring parsed `AgentStatus` data into a basic sidebar render.
